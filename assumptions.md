# Assumptions
- We assume that the system will allow a non-registered/non-authenticated user to browse and add items to a shopping cart
- We assume that the system will be available from a website and mobile applications so rest APIs are needed
- We assume that thereâ€™s no other system available for product management, taxes, users, etc.
