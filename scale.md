# Scale
- Implement a caching replication system
- Add web and database servers according to the current usage statistics
- Use and tune a load balancing system
- Instead of loading full pages, consider incrementing the use of ajax calls for small tasks like adding a product to the shopping cart, paging results, etc.
- If the demand changes from 100 per day to a 10000000 consider using a cloud system instead of adding servers that most of the time probably wonâ€™t be used
